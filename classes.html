  <!-- There are three concepts in Object-Oriented Programming Object, Class, and Methods. ES6 JavaScript supports Object-Oriented programming components.  -->

  <!-- Object: A real-time object entity means the presentation of any entity in real-time.
Class: It is the before the plan of creating any objects which is known as the blueprint of any objects which you want to create.
Methods: It communicates between the objects. -->

  <!-- Class inheritance: The ES6 Class supports the inheritance. Inheritance has the courage to create entities from existing entities. There are two types of Class in ES6: 

parent class/super class: The class extended to create new class are known as a parent class or super class.
child/sub classes: The class are newly created are known as child or sub class. Sub class inherit all the properties from parent class except constructor -->
